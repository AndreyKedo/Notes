# NVM for Windows
## Get started
* Open [nvm-windows releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
* Download nvm-setup.zip
* Unzip the archive
* Start nvm-setup.exe
* Agree with all (even in the case of a huge number of modal windows during installation)
* Run in cmd as Administrator: 
```cmd
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\nvm\nvm.exe
```
## Basic commands
* node -v - check nodejs version
* nvm install <version> - install necessary 
* nvm list - check installed versions
* nvm use <version> - 
* nvm version - version of nvm

## Issue

If **nodejs version doesn't change**:
* Rename "C:\Program Files\nodejs" to "C:\Program Files\nodejsx"
* Restart console
